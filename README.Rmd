# crssplot

**WIP** - working to convert [BoulderCodeHub/Process-CRSS-Res](https://github.com/BoulderCodeHub/Process-CRSS-Res) into a package. 

Goals are to: 

1. Provide an easy, mostly automated way to produce the "standard" crss figures accross many scenarios.
2. Provide a set of plots with a common API for creating new CRSS figures for any slot/variable. These functions can be wrapped in code from goal 1 in this package or used in other analyses/frameworks.

## Setup

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('rabutler-usbr/crsspub')
```

## Standard Figures

1. Setup a yaml file that determines which scenarios are used and which plots are created. [yaml Specification](https://github.com/BoulderCodeHub/Process-CRSS-Res/wiki/yaml-specification) includes the details about the yaml file configuration.
    * It does not matter where you save this file. It can be saved in this repository or in the CRSS folder.
2. Then call:

```
ui <- parse_yaml_input("path/to/yml/file.yml")
process_everything(ui)
```

See [doc/README.md](https://github.com/BoudlerCodeHub/Process-CRSS-Res/doc/README.md) for more details on how this process works in the overall CRSS publication process. 

## Generic Plotting Functions

This section demonstrates how to use the generic plotting functions to recreate the standard CRSS results, though it does so using a truncated/sample set of them.

```{r}
library(crssplot)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
# ex_pe is sample data frame that comes from RWDataPlyr and running the 
# automated process above
# TODO: add in sample code that shows how to generate ex_pe from RWDataPlyr and
# add in the ScenarioGroup and add in the initial conditions
```

```{r}
# Cloud figures
```

```{r}
p1 <- scens_plot_probs(
  ex_pe, years = 2021:2026,
  vars = "powell_wy_min_lt_3525", 
  subtitle = "Percent of traces less than elevation 3,525' in any water year"
) +
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 1))
p2 <- scens_plot_probs(
  ex_pe, years = 2021:2026,
  vars = "powell_wy_min_lt_3490", 
  subtitle = "Percent of traces less than elevation 3,490' in any water year"
) +
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 1))

p1 + p2 +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect")
```
